# Enhancing Fairness in Credit Scoring with Large Language Models: A Study on Bias Detection and Mitigation
This study explores the application of LLMs to improve the accuracy and fairness of credit scoring systems. The focus is on identifying inherent biases in traditional and AI-driven credit scoring models and developing methodologies to mitigate these biases effectively.

## Objectives:
* Development of an accurate and interpretable credit scoring model based on an LLM.
* Analysis of biases within the datasets, the LLM model, and how to mitigate these errors.
